The Satellite Launch Vehicle or SLV was a small-lift launch vehicle project started in the early 1970s by the Indian Space Research Organisation to
 develop the technology needed to launch satellites. SLV was intended to reach a height of 400 kilometres (250 mi) and carry a payload of 40 kg (88 lb).
 The first experimental flight of SLV-3, in August 1979, was a failure.The first successful launch took place on 18 July, 1980.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was a four-stage rocket with all solid-propellant motors.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first launch of the SLV took place in Sriharikota on 10 August 1979. The fourth and final launch of the SLV took place on 17 April 1983.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It has taken approximately seven years to realise the vehicle from start. The solid motor case for first and second stage are fabricated from 15 CDV6 steel 
sheets and third and fourth stages from fibre reinforced plastic.<p
