<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </b> was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. 
He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, 
mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme 
and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.
He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 
1974.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kalam was elected as <b>the 11th president of India </b>in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. 
Widely referred to as the <b>"People's President"</b>, he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several 
prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.
Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.</p>

<subheading> Early life and Education</subheading>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, 
then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. 
His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.
Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. 
He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics.After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, 
Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954.
 He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied 
 with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. 
 Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline".
 He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.

 Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) 
 from July 1992 to December 1999. 
 The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period and Kalam played an intensive political and technological role in their success. 

 The tests achieved their main objective of giving India the capability to build fission and thermonuclear weapons with yields up to 200 Kilotons. 
 Exclusive media coverage during the event, made Kalam a household name in India and he became the best known nuclear scientist in the nation.

 Wings of Fire: An Autobiography of A P J Abdul Kalam (1999); Ignited Minds: Unleashing the Power Within India (2002); and Target 3 Billion (2011). Among these, Wings of Fire

 hard work. The autobiography was first published in English; and has so far been translated and published in 
 13 languages including Chinese and French. Ignited Minds delves into the obstacles that are preventing India from rising up to the challenge of development.

Following his death, Kalam's body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter from Shillong to Guwahati, 
from where it was flown to New Delhi on the morning of 28 July in an air force C-130J Hercules. The flight landed at Palam Air Base
 that afternoon and was received by the President, the vice-president, the Prime Minister, Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal,
 and the three service chiefs of the Indian Armed Forces, who laid wreaths on Kalam's body. His body was then placed on a 
 gun carriage draped with the Indian flag and taken to his Delhi residence at 10 Rajaji Marg; there, the public and numerous dignitaries paid homage, 
 including former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice-president Rahul Gandhi, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.

On the morning of 29 July, Kalam's body, wrapped in the Indian flag, was taken to Palam Air Base and flown to Madurai in an air force C-130J aircraft, 
arriving at Madurai Airport that afternoon. His body was received at the airport by the three service chiefs and national and state dignitaries, including 
cabinet ministers Manohar Parrikar, Venkaiah Naidu, Pon Radhakrishnan and the governors of Tamil Nadu and Meghalaya, K Rosaiah and V. Shanmuganathan. After a 
brief ceremony, Kalam's body was flown by air force helicopter to the town of Mandapam, from where it was taken in an army truck to his hometown of Rameswaram. 
Upon arriving at Rameswaram, his body was displayed in an open area in front of the local bus station to allow the public to pay their final respects until 8 p.m. that evening.
